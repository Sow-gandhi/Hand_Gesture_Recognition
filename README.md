# Hand_Gesture_Recognition
All input images/ gestures are stored using a laptop webcam.
The captured image is then converted into binary data using
the NumPy package and processed by using the H5py
package. Now using the algorithm and functions from
OpenCV packages, the application can give out the matched
hand gestures from its trained model.
